# Chirpy - a boot.dev project
Chirpy is meant to be an intro to HTTP servers and building an API. It creates 
and runs an HTTP server that communicates with a PostgeSQL backend to run a 
Twitter clone.

# Project description from boot.dev
> Welcome to Learn HTTP Servers
> 
> In a way, this course is where everything you've learned so far on the Boot.dev back-end path comes together. Building HTTP servers is the bread-and-butter of a backend developer's day-to-day work.
> 
> This course assumes you already have a solid understanding of Go. If you don't, take a step back and take our Go course.
> Goals of This Course
> 
>     * Understand what web servers are and how they power real-world web applications
>     * Build a production-style HTTP server in Go, without the use of a framework
>     * Use JSON, headers, and status codes to communicate with clients via a RESTful API
>     * Learn what makes Go a great language for building fast web servers
>     * Use type safe SQL to store and retrieve data from a Postgres database
>     * Implement a secure authentication/authorization system with well-tested cryptography libraries
>     * Build and understand webhooks and API keys
> 
> What Is a Server?
> 
> A web server is just a computer that serves data over a network, typically the Internet. Servers run software that listens for incoming requests from clients. When a request is received, the server responds with the requested data.
> 
> Any server worth its salt can handle many requests at the same time. In Go, we use a new goroutine for each request to handle them concurrently. Let's start by practicing with goroutines.
> Assignment
> 
> In this course, we'll be working on a product called "Chirpy". Chirpy is a social network similar to Twitter.
> 
> One of Chirpy's servers is processing requests unbelievably slowly. Use a goroutine to fix the bug in the handleRequests (not handleRequest) function. The server should be able to process all the requests within the time limit.
